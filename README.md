HTML Rina-chan Board
====================

An HTML page that displays cute little pixel art block thingies that look like
the board held up by [Rina
Tennoji](https://love-live.fandom.com/wiki/Rina_Tennoji)

Made for Jess by Dave for Christmas 2019 :D

Usage
-----

Open the `index.html` and it should just work

Files
-----

- `index.html` the main HTML file - should be very simple as most logic is done in JavaScript
- `rina-chan-board.js` the main JS file with a bulk of the logic to draw and animate the board
